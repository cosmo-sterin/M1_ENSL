# In the bugged version of closure_improved
# this sigma will give only A for closure'(sigma, B)
# whereas it should output: A B C
# It is corrected (see readme) and thus
# test passed: OK
# For the same reason closure(sigma,EMPTY) should
# output A, it is the case in the debugged version.
# test passed: OK
